## Fix 1 — `api/main.py`, Line 8: Hardcoded Redis host

**Problem:** The Redis client was initialised with `host="localhost"`. Inside a Docker network, services are addressed by their service name, not `localhost`. This caused the API container to fail to connect to Redis at runtime.

**Change:**
```python
# Before
r = redis.Redis(host="localhost", port=6379)

# After
REDIS_HOST = os.getenv("REDIS_HOST", "redis")
REDIS_PORT = int(os.getenv("REDIS_PORT", "6379"))
r = redis.Redis(host=REDIS_HOST, port=REDIS_PORT, ...)
```

---

## Fix 2 — `api/main.py`, Line 8: Redis password ignored

**Problem:** The `.env` file committed in the repository defined `REDIS_PASSWORD=supersecretpassword123`, but the Redis client in `main.py` never read or used it. Any Redis instance launched with `--requirepass` would reject all connections from the API.

**Change:**
```python
# Before
r = redis.Redis(host="localhost", port=6379)

# After
REDIS_PASSWORD = os.getenv("REDIS_PASSWORD", None)
r = redis.Redis(host=REDIS_HOST, port=REDIS_PORT, password=REDIS_PASSWORD, ...)
```

---

## Fix 3 — `api/main.py`: No `/health` endpoint

**Problem:** There was no health check route. Docker's `HEALTHCHECK` instruction and `docker-compose.yml`'s `depends_on: condition: service_healthy` both require an HTTP endpoint to probe. Without one, health checks can never pass.

**Change:** Added:
```python
@app.get("/health")
def health():
    try:
        r.ping()
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=503, detail=f"Redis unreachable: {e}")
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

---

## Fix 4 — `api/main.py`, Line 13: Ambiguous queue key name

**Problem:** The API pushed jobs onto a Redis list called `"job"` (singular) with `r.lpush("job", job_id)`. The name `"job"` conflicts with the hash keys `job:{id}` used to store job status. Renamed to `"jobs"` for clarity and to eliminate the naming ambiguity.

**Change:**
```python
# Before
r.lpush("job", job_id)

# After
r.lpush("jobs", job_id)
```

---

## Fix 5 — `api/main.py`, Line 21: Silent 404 instead of HTTP error

**Problem:** When a job ID was not found, the handler returned `{"error": "not found"}` with HTTP 200. Clients (including the integration test) cannot distinguish a successful response from a not-found error without parsing the body.

**Change:**
```python
# Before
return {"error": "not found"}

# After
raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Job not found")
```

---

## Fix 6 — `api/requirements.txt`, Lines 1–3: No version pins

**Problem:** All three dependencies (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `redis`) were unpinned. This means `pip install` resolves to whatever is latest at build time, making images non-reproducible and vulnerable to breaking changes.

**Change:**
```
# Before
fastapi
uvicorn
redis

# After
fastapi==0.111.0
uvicorn[standard]==0.29.0
redis==5.0.4
python-dotenv==1.0.1
httpx==0.27.0
```

---

## Fix 7 — `worker/worker.py`, Line 6: Hardcoded Redis host

**Problem:** Same as Fix 1 — `host="localhost"` prevents the worker from connecting to Redis when running inside a Docker network.

**Change:**
```python
# Before
r = redis.Redis(host="localhost", port=6379)

# After
REDIS_HOST = os.getenv("REDIS_HOST", "redis")
r = redis.Redis(host=REDIS_HOST, port=REDIS_PORT, ...)
```

---

## Fix 8 — `worker/worker.py`, Line 6: Redis password ignored

**Problem:** Same as Fix 2 — the worker never used `REDIS_PASSWORD`, so it would fail to authenticate against a password-protected Redis.

**Change:**
```python
# Before
r = redis.Redis(host="localhost", port=6379)

# After
REDIS_PASSWORD = os.getenv("REDIS_PASSWORD", None)
r = redis.Redis(host=REDIS_HOST, port=REDIS_PORT, password=REDIS_PASSWORD, ...)
```

---

## Fix 9 — `worker/worker.py`, Lines 4 & 14–18: `signal` imported but never used

**Problem:** `import signal` was present at the top of the file, but no signal handlers were ever registered. This means `docker stop` (which sends `SIGTERM`) would immediately kill the worker process mid-job, corrupting any in-flight job and leaving it permanently stuck in `queued` status.

**Change:** Added proper SIGTERM and SIGINT handlers with a clean shutdown loop:
```python
shutdown = False

def handle_sigterm(signum, frame):
    global shutdown
    logger.info("Received SIGTERM — finishing current job then exiting.")
    shutdown = True

signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, handle_sigterm)
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, handle_sigterm)

while not shutdown:
    job = r.brpop("jobs", timeout=5)
    ...
```
The worker now finishes its current job and then exits cleanly.

---

## Fix 10 — `worker/worker.py`, Line 15: Queue name mismatch (paired with Fix 4)

**Problem:** Worker consumed from `"job"` — renamed to `"jobs"` to match the API.

**Change:**
```python
# Before
job = r.brpop("job", timeout=5)

# After
job = r.brpop("jobs", timeout=5)
```

---

## Fix 11 — `worker/worker.py`, Line 53: Missing trailing newline (W292)

**Problem:** The file ended without a trailing newline. This caused `flake8` to report `W292 no newline at end of file`, which would fail the lint stage of the CI pipeline.

**Change:** Added a trailing newline at the end of `worker.py`.

---

## Fix 12 — `worker/requirements.txt`, Line 1: No version pin

**Problem:** `redis` was unpinned, resulting in non-deterministic builds.

**Change:**
```
# Before
redis

# After
redis==5.0.4
python-dotenv==1.0.1
```

---

## Fix 13 — `frontend/app.js`, Line 6: Hardcoded API URL

**Problem:** `const API_URL = "http://localhost:8000"` hardcodes the API address. When the frontend runs in a container, it cannot reach `localhost:8000`; it must use the Docker service name `api`.

**Change:**
```javascript
// Before
const API_URL = "http://localhost:8000";

// After
const API_URL = process.env.API_URL || 'http://api:8000';
```

---

## Fix 14 — `frontend/app.js`: No `/health` endpoint

**Problem:** No health route existed, so Docker's `HEALTHCHECK` for the frontend had nothing to probe.

**Change:** Added:
```javascript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ status: 'ok' });
});
```

---

## Fix 15 — `api/.env`: Real credentials committed at wrong location

**Problem (credential exposure):** The file `api/.env` was tracked in version control and contained a real Redis password (`REDIS_PASSWORD=supersecretpassword123`). Secrets must never be committed to version control.

**Problem (wrong location):** Even if the credentials were safe, `api/.env` is the wrong place for this file. `docker compose` automatically loads variables only from a `.env` file at the **project root** (the same directory as `docker-compose.yml`). A `.env` inside `api/` is not loaded by Compose, and `api/main.py` does not call `load_dotenv()`, so the file had zero effect at runtime.

**Changes:**
- Added `.env` (and `*.env`) to `.gitignore` at the repo root to prevent re-committing
- Removed `api/.env` from git tracking: `git rm --cached api/.env`
- Deleted the `api/.env` file from disk entirely
- Created `.env` at the **project root** (from `.env.example`) — this is where Docker Compose reads it
- Created `.env.example` at the project root with placeholder values documenting all required variables

---

## Fix 16 — `frontend/package.json`: No `package-lock.json`

**Problem:** Without a lockfile, `npm install` resolves dependency trees at build time, producing non-reproducible images and potential version drift. The frontend `Dockerfile` uses `npm ci`, which requires a `package-lock.json` — without one, the Docker build would fail.

**Change:** Generated `package-lock.json` by running `npm install` once locally and committed it. The Dockerfile now uses `npm ci --omit=dev` to enforce the lockfile on every build.

---

## Fix 17 — `api/tests/test_main.py`: Incorrect mock strategy for Redis

**Problem:** The original test file patched `redis.Redis` (the class constructor) using `patch("redis.Redis")`. However, `main.py` creates the Redis client `r` at **module import time** as a module-level variable. By the time the patch was applied, `r` had already been assigned the real client object. As a result, endpoint functions called the real (unpatched) `r`, causing 5 of 7 tests to fail.

**Change:** Changed the mock strategy to patch `main.r` directly — replacing the already-created module-level instance with a `MagicMock`:
```python
# Before (did not intercept calls to the already-created r)
with patch("redis.Redis") as mock_cls:
    mock_instance = MagicMock()
    mock_cls.return_value = mock_instance

# After (replaces the live instance on the module itself)
mock = MagicMock()
with patch.object(main, "r", mock):
    yield mock
```
All 7 tests now pass with 100% code coverage.
